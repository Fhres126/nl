norlang{

this artificial language is called norlang(Normal Language) in english.

advertisement{

norlang will can become the international language.

norlang dont have exception.

over 65% of words is compound word or antonym or arranged in an orderly way.

so you can remember words easily.

one sentence has only one meaning.

eg 'A and B of C' can be interpreted as '(A and B) of C' and 'A and (B of C)' in english.

but in norlang, 'af C bf A B' mean only '(A and B) of C'.

'bf A af C B' mean only 'A and (B of C)'.

'i know you' in norlang is 'nbbd'.(This is pronounced differently from English. it is easy to pronounce)

english is 80bit(in ascii code).

norlang is 16 bit(one letter is 4bit).

norlang is five times more efficient than English.

so norlang reduces environmental pollution.

norlang helps easy communication.

norlang brings peace and helps technology grow.

norlang is phonetic script.

norlang versions of barcodes and QR codes is called NL QR.

Since norlang is a binary language, it can easily be converted into NL QR and and norlang version morse code.

norlang can express all meanings using only binary.

NL QR1 is over 1.5 times more efficient than a barcode.(both image mean same)

NL QR2 uses over 5 times less space than a QR code.(the both image mean 'i am people')

NL QR means the same from any angle like QR code.


NL QR can be expressed in one, two, or three and more dimensions(pdf user can see image).

you can use norlang fluently in just one month

It is the simplest, most efficient, easiest and most logical future international language.

norlang can be used in programming.

it is called ECL.

alphabet{

* alphabet is only 0 and 1 then it can be expressed as 16 latin letter.

a:0000. b:1000. c:0100. d:1100.

e:0010. f:1010. g:0110. h:1110.

i:0001. j:1001. k:0101. l:1101.

m:0011. n:1011. o:0111. p:1111.

norlang uses only lowercase letters.

more efficient alphabet is here(only pdf user can see. bottom to top writting alphabet):

one word consist of 8n bit.

8n-th bit determines length of word.

8n-th bit 0 plays the same role as whitespace of english so it deosnt need whitespace.

* 8n-th bit 1 make the word consist of more bit.(eg sentence '{0000101(1)0110000(0)}{0111000(0)}' consist of two words.

between '(' and ')' is 8n-th bit.

between '{' and '}' is one word.)

it means that word whose 2n-th letter is between 'a'(0000) and 'h'(1110) consist of smaller quantity bits.

the example converted to latin letter is 'anga oa'. 

but i will use whitespace to make you easily understand.

pronunciation{

* Two letters make one syllable.

* (2n-1)th letter is pronounced as initial consonant. 

* 2n-th letter is pronounced as vowel also final consonant.

eg 'fc ee anba' is pronounced as 'neo da maemboo'.

(2n-1)th letter 'f' is pronounced as 'n'.

2n-th letter 'c' is pronounced as 'eo'.

(2n-1)th letter 'e' is pronounced as 'd'.('e' is 'da' in pronunciation chart)

2n-th letter 'e' is pronounced as 'a'.

then 'anba' is pronounced as 'maemboo' then it can be pronounced as 'maeb'.

pronunciation chart{

sound consists of decibels (dB) and hertz (Hz).

it is arranged with lower Hz sounds coming first.(eg m(100hz) < s(14000hz))

so it is not biased toward any specific culture.

basic{

* grammar of norlang is same as math.

* transitive verb is function.

* object is parameter.

* norlang use VOS word order.

* norlang sentence 'A B' mean 'B is A'.

* norlang sentence consist of two objects.

eg 'djca   aoad' mean 'ore is solid'.

'djca' mean 'solid'.

'aoad' mean 'ore'.

* some word must have parameter like function.

'jd bd   oa' mean 'i think you', 'thing that think you is me'.

'jd' mean 'thing that think'.

'bd' mean 'you'

* 'jd' is function that must have parameter so 'jd bd' is one object.

'jd bd' mean 'thing that think you'.

'oa' mean 'i'.

* if subject is omitted, subject is 'i' so 'i think you' can be expressed as sentence 'jd bd' and 'jd bd oa'.

this grammar can express every meaning.

eg 'The happy boy gives her a small book in the morning and smiles.' is expressed as 'ab gb if ab dmkg pf bida ajmd kjkc ac hied ajea ab dmdg boob'.

you need to know how to interpret a dictionary to learn in detail.

<How to interpret a word dictionary>{

'fojb r!=dead thing.'{

word is expressed as it in word dictionary.

* far left is norlang word.

* far right is meaning of this word.

* between norlang word and '!' is word type.

* 'r' is an abbreviation for 'reality'.

only thing that can exist in reality is reality type object.

}

'kjgg r!=alive thing.//anto die'{

'//' is for an additional explanation.

'anto' is an abbreviation for 'antonym'.

* 'anto A' mean 'this word is antonym of A'.

* The antonym form is the inversion of the original word's bits.

0 becomes 1. 1 becomes 0.

eg antonym of 
'fojb'(10100111,10011000) is 
'kjgg'(01011001,01100110).

}

'jd r!o=thing that think A.'{

between '!' and '=' is parameter that this function must have.

'o' is an abbreviation for 'object'.

any object can be in object type parameter.

'A' in right hand side is first input value of parameter of this function.

eg 'jd oa' mean 'thing that think me'.

}

'pf si!=continue speaking.'{

'si' is abbreviation for 'sign'.

'si' type words don't interface with all words.

eg sentence 'jd pf bd oa' means 'jd bd oa' because the word doesn't interface with 'si' type words.

You can use 'pf' word to continue what you were saying before.

}

}<How to interpret a word dictionary>

any word can be in object type parameter.

'jd oa' is one object.

'jd jd oa' is one object and mean 'thing that think thing that think me'.

'jd ad oa'='i think', 'thing that think something is me'{

ad si!=symbol that omit one parameter.

parameter of 'jd' is omitted by 'ad'.

'fc r!o,o=thing that ask B about A.'{

'!A,B' mean this function need 'A' and 'B' as parameter.

A is first input value of this function of norlang word, the second one as B, and then C, D, E, F, and so on.

parameter type that this function must have is object and object.

eg 'fc aoad  oa' mean 'thing that ask me(oa) about ore(aoad)'.

}

'ha p!o=this A'{

'p' is abbreviation for 'parameter'.

parameter value determines type of this function.

eg 'ha fojb' is reality type cuz fojb is reality type object.

}

'ge 2p!o-o-n=thing that become B using A.'{

'2p' mean '2rd parameter'.

type of 2rd input value determines type of this word.

eg type of 'ge oa kjgg' is reality type object cuz 'kjgg' is reality type object.

The symbol '-' means that if the parameter is omitted by symbol that omit parameter then the next parameter is omitted too.

you can omit all parameter of 'ge' with only one 'ad'.

}

'oa r!=i.//com express,this,symbol that omit parameter..'{

'com' is an abbreviation for 'compound word'.

'com A,B' mean 'this word is compound word of A and B'.

'oa' is compound word of 'kb' and 'ha' and 'ad'.

'kb ha ad' mean 'thing that express this'.

total length of all that words is 24bit.

but i want to express word 'i' as 8bit word cuz word 'i' is used a lot.

The floor of 8 divided by 3 is 2.

2bit is from 'kb'(01,011000).

2bit is from 'ha'(11,100000).

4bit is from 'ad'(0000,1100).

result is 'oa'(01,11,0000).

}

'anga r!=people.//pron de mensch'{

'pron' is an abbreviation for 'pronunciation'.

'pron de mensch' means that the pronunciation of this word is derived from the German word 'mensch'.

'de' mean german in ISO code alpha2.

'gb p!s-n=reason why A2 is A1'{

's' is an abbreviation for 'sentence'.

's' is 'o-o'.

so 'A1' is first 'o'.

'A2' is second 'o'.

'bf p!c o=A1 and A2 and....'{

'c o' mean 'this word have object type parameter until it met symbol that omit parameter'.

antonym of 'he' seems  'id'(00011100).

antonyms have an order.

An element must exist for the owner to exist.

so word bit of 'element' must smaller than 'have'.

for developer{

The efficiency of inaccurate expressions and accurate expressions should be similar to same.

pronunciation chart order is low herz->high herz.

exact expression is important than efficiency.

one sentence must mean only one mean.

purpose of language is only communication and efficient.

0 cannot be used for counting order.

exception should none.

relative things must have standard.

sentence 'people i' means 'i have over 70% of features of people'.it is called 'ratio word'.
10.arrangement order of word is 'number->most common->'.

word formation rule{

word that need parameter{

1:meaning of word whose parameter is all or nothing is what other word can express.

2:relative word.

transitive verb.

test sentence{

input word your wonder to @.

Forgotten @ repeats itself.(eg history word dont need parameter. try input history of. is it owe?)

people in @ love you.

There should be no discrimination based on @(that is features of discrimination word. so 'element of all' word legal)

}test sentence

}word that need parameter

antonym{

bit of antonym is inverse of original word so 0 become 1, 1 become 0.

word that should come first{

priority-est is

low number(below->more).

order(eg seller exist to make buyer,, women is made before men exist)

original:'df' mean 'meeb' so 'me' is first.

many quantity:photon is mannier than neutrino.

}word that should come first

if spectific word have lot of antonym, created by antonym mechnism is 'root(no slave,no king)->number(0% can=cant)->purpose(weapon,treatment tool,,intend,evolution)->diffrence set(dont know,know)'.

}antonym

compound word{

1.'know' is 'have'+'information-of'.

2.'girlfriend'='girl'+'love' cuz original is 'wae'+'girl'+'love'+'omit gramr'.it should keep word order.

3.'teethbrush'='teeth'+'brush'.

4.phonetic loanword:'russia'->'romsimna(russia in russian. slient consonant become 'n')'.
'higgs particle'->'(kims('h'->'k')).

if new compound word overlap with other compound word,element word of new compound word become small.(ex '00,10' become '01'. then if area of element is too small, use XOR).

length of bit of element of compound word must power of two.

if length of bit of element of compound word is not power of two, element of compound word such as symbol that omit grammar, ea, of, and, or, also is omitted to be power of two.

small bit word is first in situation whose order doesn't matter.

if length of element compound word of compound word is less than whole bit divided by 8, use antonym mechanism.

}compound word

word formation rule that should be used first{

If a word can be expressed as an antonym and also as a compound word.

if word created by the antonym mechanism has the same meaning as the original word(eg mmfd=dlke) then use compound word mechanism.

If the original word too similar to compound wkrd, use antonym mechanism(eg i(com expres,this,o) -> you(com sense, this, o))

If the bits of a word expressed as a compound word differ by less than 1/4 from its antonym, use the antonym mechanism..

and If a compound word consists of two words, use the compound word mechanism first using their antonym.(eg mmfd->dnfd)

If not, use the antonym mechanism first.

math expression efficient?

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) offers advantages over Polish Notation (PN) primarily in processing and storage efficiency, particularly in calculator implementations and compiler design. RPN simplifies the evaluation process by using a stack-based approach, requiring less complex logic and potentially reducing memory usage compared to PN. Additionally, RPN can be more efficient for complex calculations and is less prone to errors when entering equations
